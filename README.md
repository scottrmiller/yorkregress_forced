# yorkregress_forced
**Yorkregress_forced** performs a York regression, a weighted bivariate regression in which both variables have errors (Model II or errors-in-variables regression), and forces the solution through the origin.  This code uses the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm of York et al. (2004).  The output of this function includes the estimate of slope, standard error of slope, correlation coefficient, t-statistic, p-value of the slope, reduced weighted chi-square (or mean squared weighted deviation, MSWD) as a goodness-of-fit statistic, standard deviation of chi-square, the p-value of chi-square, and the number of iterations in the MLE routine.  This code is based on the method of Thirumalai et al. (2011) and Trappitsch et al. (2018) for forcing the solution through a point.  York regression has a long history of use in the geosciences but has wide applicability in empirical studies where both variables commonly contain errors (Wehr and Saleska, 2017).
